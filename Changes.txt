[DMG] GB Core Updates:
----------------------
- Added input for Xbox Controller (and any XInput compatible joypad).
- Structured the foundations for future cross platform support.
- Implemented the instruction 'DAA' that was stubbed until now.
- Fixed all processor flag checks in instructions, passing all cpu_instrs individual tests.
- Improved Timer handling, but still not accurate enough to pass timing tests.
- Basic Serial I/O emulation, as if no external devices are connected.





Version 0.0.4 (Alpha) - AUG/19/2017
===================================

Supported Cores:
----------------
- Game Boy - Classic GB emulator. Please, check the emulation
  status (https://github.com/fattard/xFF/blob/0.0.4/GB_Status.md)
  with details of what is supported, and what is in progress and known issues.

  that will allow running all real cores.
  More info: https://esolangs.org/wiki/BytePusher
  
[DMG] GB Core Updates:
----------------------
- Added support for running official bootROMs (disabled by default, must
  edit config file that is created after running for first time).
- Added support for all graphics modes, including Backgrounds, Window overlay,
  and Sprites.
- Input control using keyboard, still not possible to customize.
  Check main page (https://github.com/fattard/xFF) for more information,
  and also status page with in-depth emulation
  status (https://github.com/fattard/xFF/blob/0.0.4/GB_Status.md).
- Most of hardware is emulated now, altough accuracy is just OK.





Version 0.0.3 (Alpha) - AUG/07/2017
===================================

New Core Support:
-----------------
- DMG - Support for Game Boy emulation. Please, check the emulation
  status (https://github.com/fattard/xFF/blob/0.0.3/GB_Status.md) with details of what
  is supported, and what is in progress and known issues.

Other Supported Cores:
----------------------
- BytePusher - A special test core to help me creating the foundations
  that will allow running all real cores.
  More info: https://esolangs.org/wiki/BytePusher
  
[DMG] GB Core Updates:
----------------------
- Basic background support, enough to run test roms such as Blargg's cpu_instrs individual
  tests (http://gbdev.gg8.se/files/roms/blargg-gb-tests/) and some mooneye-gb
  tests (https://gekkio.fi/files/mooneye-gb/latest/).
- There's an embedded custom bootROM, so no need to provide one.
  Note that the current state of emulation will not run with official bootROMS,
  due to missing pieces of emulation like scanline counting and LCD register statuses.
